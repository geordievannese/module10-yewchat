I refactored the entire view method by breaking it into semantic sectionsâ€”wrapping the users list in an <aside>, the chat area in <main>, and further dividing that into <header>, <section>, and <footer> so the structure is clearer. I replaced the raw if inside the message rendering with a proper { if â€¦ { html!{â€¦} } else { html!{â€¦} } } block so it compiles without errors. To simplify the code, I swapped the old .map().collect::<Html>() calls for the more concise for â€¦ in iteration. I also cleaned up the Tailwind classes using min-h-screen instead of forcing h-screen, correcting text-white and fill-current for SVG coloring, and tidying spacing utilitiesâ€”so the styling renders correctly and the markup is easier to read and maintain.
